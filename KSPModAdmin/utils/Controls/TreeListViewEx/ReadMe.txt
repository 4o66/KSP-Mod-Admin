The control TreeListView and all classes in the Namespace KSPMODAdmin.Utils.CommonTools
are from the open source project "ListView with Columns" on Code Project.

This project is published under The Code Project Open License (CPOL)

I've added cell editing and checkbox support and removed all code i don't need (for a better Mono (http://mono-project.com/Main_Page) support).
The code i've added is marked by "added by BH" and is under the same license (Code Project Open License (CPOL)).

See link above to get the full source code of the "ListView with Columns" project.
