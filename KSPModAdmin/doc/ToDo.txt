______BUGS______

- TreeListView 
  - BUG - Open Editor overlaps the vertical scrollbar.
  - BUG - Editor don't move/resize on control resize.
  - BUG - On column resize the Column will be sorted (No sort on col resize).
  - BUG - You cant resize the 1st column to the left, to make it smaller.
          You have to make the furthest column on the right BIGGER, by dragging the right column border outside the KSP MA window.

- CHECK:
  Oh, found another bug! When I used "Import new Flag" to import a flag from disk, and then tried to use the "Delete Flag" button, I got this dialogue box saying it is in use: [URL]http://i.imgur.com/jH0ULvu.png[/URL]
  When I go to delete the file in Windows, it says it is in use by KSPModAdmin. This was my first time adding a flag, in case that's relevant.
  Closing and opening KSPMA solved the problem.
